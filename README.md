Simple Dynamic Time Warping Python Code


Creates a class for calculating Dynamic Time Warping distance, finding a warping path, and warping signals. Currently only for 1 dimentional signals. Can handle signals of differing lengths by interpolating the input signal to match the sampling of the template signal.
